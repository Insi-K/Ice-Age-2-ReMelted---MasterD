# **Ice Age 2 ReMelted - MasterD**
This is my first project ever made in Unreal Engine. Here, I've applied all the concepts I learnt after studying a one year course on how to program games using this engine.

The main concept of this project was to replicate the core mechanics of Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a videogame released back in 2006 for PC, GameCube, Wii and PS2 consoles.

In order to reduce scope, two levels were developed, which incorporate different gameplay dynamics. 

You can download the game or take a look at the soruce code.

**NOTE:** *Some of the assets used on the game are original assets used in other games. By no means I claim ownership on this material and was only used with learning purposes. This project is not intended to be used for profit.*
